# Shape Postgresql Comparison

We got this code from the Github repo of Spider, the Yale SQL generation benchmark, and we want to use it to test some SQLs. We changed it a bit to support Postgresql instead of sqlite. We wrote a some test SQLs that should work (and we feed the same as golden queries and prediction queries).
However, we keep getting errors, exceptions, and weird behaviors.

Command:
```python
python evaluation.py --gold gold.txt --pred pred.txt
```

Help us solve this!

# Objectives

- Understand how the code works and what it does
- Understand the errors, why the happen, and fix them
- Encapsulate the service into containers that can be deployed and used in a cloud environment
    - The container should expose a REST API that allows to submit gold/predicted pairs, and get back the evaluation for them

# Tools

- python / pip
- docker
- make
- git

# Evaluation Criteria

- Deep understanding of the code and it's limitations
    - Proficiency in new codebases
- Debugging and fixing the issues
    - Understanding why a certain query doesn't work
    - Fixing the issue properly in a way that addresses the root cause
- Modern software practices
    - Designing and implementing the container architecture

# Duartion

2.5 hours for finishing the exercise, half an hour to talk about it.
